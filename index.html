        <h1> The Metropolitan Museum of Art</h1>
        <p>  For nearly a century and a half, the Met has remained the <b>cultural epicenter</b> of New York City, thanks to forward-thinking exhibits 
             and an extensive permanent collection. With its Gothic-Revival-style building, iconic tiered steps, and Central Park location,
             the building is a sight to be seen. But step inside its Great Hall—as a ceaseless parade of museumgoers move to-and-fro—and you’ll feel the 
             overwhelming sense of possibility and discovery that lays beyond. If you've got limited time or compatriots with limited attention spans,
             start with the Temple of Dendur, a 2,000-year-old <b>soaring Egyptian</b> temple.</p>
